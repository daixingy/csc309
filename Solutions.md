## Basic features for our `phase 3: back end`:
Our web uses MongoDB as our server-side database. It connects the same APIs (ITUNES Search and Lyrics.ovh) which we used in previous two phases.
Like most music-sharing platform, our website allows a variety of different users to use
the application and manage their own data such as their favourite songs and their 
post comments. Besides the 'sign up' and 'log in' function, There are three basic  features of our website: Lyrics search, daily music push and real-time music sharing.
